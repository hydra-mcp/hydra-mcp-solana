- **WalletFinder**: Interface for connecting to blockchain wallets
- **IOSDesktop**: Specialized interface for iOS devices

## Build and Deployment

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

The built files will be located in the `dist` directory.

### Deployment Process

#### Using Caddy Server (Recommended)

1. Install Caddy Server
   
   Please refer to the [Caddy official documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install) for installation.

2. Configure Caddyfile

   Create or edit the Caddyfile:

   ```
   your-domain.com {
     root * /path/to/hydra-front/dist
     
     # Set up SPA routing
     try_files {path} {path}/ /index.html
     
     # Define static resource matcher
     @static {
       path *.css *.js *.ico *.gif *.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.svg *.webp *.woff *.woff2
     }
     
     # Static resource cache settings
     header @static Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable"
     
     # HTML file cache settings
     @html {
       path *.html
     }
     header @html Cache-Control "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
     
     # API proxy settings (if needed)
     reverse_proxy /api/* your_backend_api_server
     
     # Enable file server
     file_server
   }
   ```

3. Start Caddy Server

   ```bash
   caddy run
   ```

#### Using Docker Deployment

1. Use Dockerfile

   The project already includes a Dockerfile, which can be built directly:

   ```bash
   docker build -t hydra-front .
   docker run -d -p 80:80 hydra-front
   ```

2. Use docker-compose

   The project provides a docker-compose.yml file, which can be used to deploy both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Start the service
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # View logs
   docker-compose logs -f
   
   # Stop the service
   docker-compose down
   ```

   Note: Please adjust the configuration in docker-compose.yml according to your actual situation before using it.

## Environment Variables

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: API server base URL
- `VITE_BASE_URL`: Optional alternative API base URL (for development/testing)

## API Documentation

HYDRA-AI frontend uses the `/agent/chat/completions` API endpoint to interact with the AI assistant, implementing blockchain project analysis functionality. This API is similar to the structure of OpenAI's Chat Completions API, suitable for frontend developers familiar with LLM APIs. For the complete API documentation, please refer to [API documentation](API.md).

### Endpoint

```
POST /agent/chat/completions
```

### Authentication
- Requires an authenticated user session
- Uses JWT authentication (managed by the `get_current_active_user` dependency)

### Request Format

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Analyze the project at address 0x123..."
    }
  ],
  "stream": true,
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 1024,
  "project_context": {
    "additional_context": "any relevant context"
  }
}
```

### Response Types

API provides two response modes:
1. **Non-streaming response** - Full response returned once
2. **Streaming response** - Returned in Server-Sent Events (SSE) format, containing the following event types:
   - **Stage event** - Represents different stages of the analysis process
   - **Content event** - Passes actual content blocks
   - **Error event** - Passes error information
   - **Done event** - Represents the end of the stream
